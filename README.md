# Medical image captioning and speech generation by English and Amharic version for visullay impaired people
We are thrilled to share our latest innovation: a cutting-edge Medical Image Caption and speech Generation System  by both ENglish and Amharic developed using VGG16-LSTM, ViT-GPT2, and ViT-Llama models. This system generates detailed medical reports,  provides audio outputs  and Amharic version for accessibility, designed specifically for cancer patients and visually impaired individuals.

✨ Key Technical Highlights:

🔹 Model Architecture: Model fussed models such as Vission Tranformer(VIT)-GPT2(LLM) and VGG16-LSTM 

=> Feature Extraction: VGG16 and Vision Transformer (ViT) for image features.

=> Caption Generation: GPT-2, Llama and LSTM for natural language processing.

🔹 Model Saving & Deployment:

Models and tokenizers are saved using Keras and trained tokenizer, ensuring reusability and scalability.

🌟 Key Functionalities:
- 1️⃣ Upload Medical Image

Users can upload images directly to the interface.
- 2️⃣ Generate Text Report
The AI generates physician-like medical image reports with precision.
- 3️⃣ Convert Report to Audio
Reports are instantly converted into audio, ensuring accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
- 4. Translate Generated Captions to Amharic:
Automatically translate generated captions to Amharic, ensuring local accessibility and inclusivity.

🔄 How It Works:
- Step 1: Upload the medical image to the Streamlit interface.
- Step 2: The deployed generative model processes the image to generate a detailed report.
- step 3: translate generated captions to Amharic, ensuring local accessibility and inclusivity
- Step 4: The report is converted into audio for enhanced accessibility and patient support.
  

By combining state-of-the-art generative AI models and user-centric design, this system empowers healthcare professionals and enhances patient care.

🎯 Impact:
1. Report writing with out  as of the physician with Good precision
2. Accessibility for visually impaired cancer patients.
3.  ensuring local accessibility and inclusivity using tralation into Amharic version
4. AI-generated insights to assist healthcare providers in diagnosis.
   
A streamlined, interactive deployment via Streamlit for demonstration and future integration.
We are excited to lead the way in AI-powered healthcare solutions!
