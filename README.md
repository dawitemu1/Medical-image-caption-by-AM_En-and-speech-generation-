# Medical image captioning and speech generation by English and Amharic version for visullay impaired people
We are thrilled to share our latest innovation: a cutting-edge Medical Image Caption Generation System developed using VGG16-LSTM & ViT-GPT2 models. This system generates detailed medical reports and provides audio outputs for accessibility, designed specifically for cancer patients and visually impaired individuals.

✨ Key Technical Highlights:

🔹 Model Architecture: Model fussed models such as Vission Tranformer(VIT)-GPT2(LLM) and VGG16-LSTM 

=> Feature Extraction: VGG16 and Vision Transformer (ViT) for image features.

=> Caption Generation: GPT-2 and LSTM for natural language processing.

🔹 Model Saving & Deployment:

Models and tokenizers are saved using Keras and trained tokenizer, ensuring reusability and scalability.

🌟 Key Functionalities:
- 1️⃣ Upload Medical Image

Users can upload images directly to the interface.
- 2️⃣ Generate Text Report
The AI generates physician-like medical image reports with precision.
- 3️⃣ Convert Report to Audio
Reports are instantly converted into audio, ensuring accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

🔄 How It Works:
- Step 1: Upload the medical image to the Streamlit interface.
- Step 2: The deployed generative model processes the image to generate a detailed report.
- Step 3: The report is converted into audio for enhanced accessibility and patient support.

By combining state-of-the-art generative AI models and user-centric design, this system empowers healthcare professionals and enhances patient care.

🎯 Impact:
1. Report writing with out  as of the physician with Good precision
2. Accessibility for visually impaired cancer patients.
3. AI-generated insights to assist healthcare providers in diagnosis.
   
A streamlined, interactive deployment via Streamlit for demonstration and future integration.
We are excited to lead the way in AI-powered healthcare solutions!
